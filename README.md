# Project 1
## Measuring drop spreading law

This project was designed to get to grips with the methods of computational neuroscience.
Using provided data, I compared two different laws that describe how a liquid drop spreads out over a surface to determine the most accurate law.
This was done using a least square regression fit and reduced chi-squared analysis.

# Project 2
## Numerical solutions to damped harmonic oscillator

This project tested multiple different models for damped harmonic oscillators using numerical integration.
Forced and driven systems were then explored.

# Project 3
## Monte-carlo modelling of particle scattering through different materials

This project was about modelling the attenuation, scattering and transmission of neutrons through different materials. 
A big part of this project was to reduce complexity and runtime in order to simulate 10000 neutrons over 3 runs to calculate percentages.
Using these results I then found the mean free path for the different materials.
